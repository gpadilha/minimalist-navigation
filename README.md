### How to run

To run the project, please copy the files to a web server that you might have running on your local or simply run the command `npx http-server` in the project folder (requires npm installed) then access the url provided by the web server.

A web server is required so the HTML file is able to import the type="module" js file. Opening the HTML file directly on the browser (without a web server) will throw a CORS error on the browser's console and it won't work.
